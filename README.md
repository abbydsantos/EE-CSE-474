# EE-CSE-474

This folder contains all relevent files for the projects done in EE/CSE 474: Introduction to Embedded Systems. All labs were completed using the BeagleBone Black with additional peripherals. 

Lab 1: Build a 3-bit up counter represented by LEDs, with a musical scale simultaneously playing with each note.

Lab 2: Interface with an LCD display. We created a Simon Says like game.

Lab 3: Use a Linux Kernel Module to interface with the LCD display and expand on previously created game.

Lab 4: Interface with an H-bridge and motor to create a self-driving tank equipped with distance sensors to avoid obstacles. 

Lab 5: Expand on tank in Lab 4, allowing it to run untethered via startup script. Created an Andriod Application that interfaces via Bluetooth UART communication to the tank. Manual and Self-Driving modes, as well as a voice-control mode.
